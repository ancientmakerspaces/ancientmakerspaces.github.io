# Ancient MakerSpaces 2022

Ancient MakerSpaces showcases digital approaches to the study of the ancient world. This AIA-SCS Annual Meeting session features lightning talks, project demonstrations, and a virtual coffee hour.

Since 2017 (and with a brief hiatus in 2020), Ancient MakerSpaces has served as a venue at the AIA-SCS Annual Meeting for scholars, librarians, and students to share their ongoing digital scholarship and pedagogical work, as well as a space for hands-on, peer-based learning about digital resources and computational methods.
